# # CrunchieMunchies
# 
# You work in marketing for a food company <b>myCorps</b>, which is developing a new kind of tasty, wholesome cereal called <b>CrunchieMunchies</b>. 
# 
# You want to demonstrate to consumers how healthy your cereal is in comparison to other leading brands, so you’ve dug up nutritional data on several different competitors.
# 
# Your task is to use <em>NumPy statistical calculations</em> to analyze this data and prove that your <b>CrunchieMunchies</b> is the healthiest choice for consumers.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 

# # Task STEPS
# 

# 1.First, import numpy.

# In[1]:


# your code goes here
import numpy as np


# 2.Look over the <b><em>cereal.csv</em></b> file. This file contains the reported calorie amounts for different cereal brands. Load the data from the file and save it as <b><em>calorie_stats.</em></b>
# 
# 

# In[2]:


# your code goes here
calorie_stats=np.genfromtxt('cereal.csv',delimiter=',')
calorie_stats


# 3.There are <em>60 calories per serving of CrunchieMunchies</em>. How much <b>higher</b> is the <b>average calorie count</b> of your competition?
# 
# Save the answer to the variable <b>average_calories</b> and print the variable to the terminal to see the answer.
# 

# In[3]:


# your code goes here
average_calories=np.sum(calorie_stats)/len(calorie_stats)
average_calories


# 4.Does the <b>average calorie count</b> adequately reflect the distribution of the dataset? Let’s sort the data and see.
# 
# <b><em>Sort</em></b> the data and save the result to the variable <b>calorie_stats_sorted</b>. Print the sorted data to the terminal.
# 

# In[4]:


# your code goes here
calorie_stats_sorted=np.sort(calorie_stats)
calorie_stats_sorted


# 5.Do you see what I’m seeing? Looks like <b><em>the majority of the cereals are higher than the mean</em></b>. Let’s see if the <b>median</b> is a better representative of the dataset.
# 
# Calculate the median of the dataset and save your answer to <b><em >median_calories</em></b>. Print the median so you can see how it compares to the mean.

# In[5]:


# your code goes here
median_calories=np.median(calorie_stats)
median_calories


# 6.While the median demonstrates that <b><em><q>at least half of our values are over 100 calories</q></em></b>, it would be more impressive to show that a significant portion of the competition has a higher calorie count that CrunchieMunchies.
# 
# <b>Calculate different percentiles</b> and print them to the terminal until you find the lowest percentile that is greater than 60 calories. Save this value to the variable <b>nth_percentile</b>.
# 

# In[6]:


# your code goes here
nth_percentile=''
for i in range(100):
    per=np.percentile(calorie_stats,i)
    if per>60:
        nth_percentile=i
        print(nth_percentile)
        break


# 7.While the percentile shows us that<b><em><q>the majority of the competition has a much higher calorie count</q></em></b>, it’s an awkward concept to use in marketing materials.
# 
# Instead, let’s calculate the percentage of cereals that <b><em><q>have more than 60 calories per serving</q></em></b>. Save your answer to the variable <b><em>more_calories</em></b> and print it to the terminal

# In[7]:


# your code goes here
more_calories=100-nth_percentile
more_calories


# 8.Wow! That’s a really high percentage. That’s going to be very useful when we promote CrunchieMunchies. But one question is, <b><em>how much variation exists in the dataset? </b></em></q>Can we make the generalization that most cereals have around 100 calories or is the spread even greater?
# 
# Calculate the amount of variation by finding the <b><em>standard deviation</em</b> Save your answer to <b><em>calorie_std</em></b> and print to the terminal. How can we incorporate this value into our analysis?

# In[8]:


# your code goes here
calorie_std=np.std(calorie_stats)
calorie_std


# 9.Write a short paragraph that sums up your findings and how you think this data could be used to 
# <b>myCorp’s</b> advantage when marketing CrunchieMunchies.
# 
# 
# The mean value of calorie_stats is around 107. The median tells that more than half of the calories_stats are higher than 100. The standard deviation shows that the calorie_stats may deviate upto 19.3 from mean value, which shows that the data is a bit spread. Over all result shows that majority of products have more than 100 calories per serving. As CrunchieMunchies calories per serving is 60, this shows that this product clearly stands out as it has very less calories than the average colories count. So it is more healthier and safer to eat than the rest of the products.
